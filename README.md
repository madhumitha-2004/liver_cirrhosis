# 🩺 Liver Cirrhosis Prediction Using Machine Learning

**Revolutionizing Liver Care:** A Machine Learning–Powered Web App for Predicting Liver Cirrhosis  
Built with 💻 Python, 🧠 Random Forest, and 🌐 Flask

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Liver cirrhosis is a life-threatening disease that often goes undetected until advanced stages.  
This project aims to build a predictive model to help **detect liver cirrhosis early** using patient data such as enzyme levels, protein ratios, and age.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- ✅ Predict the likelihood of liver cirrhosis from clinical lab data
- ✅ Provide real-time predictions through a simple web interface
- ✅ Support medical professionals in early intervention and diagnosis
